# LEARNING DIARY
I checked the general information and understood the main focus of the course, which is to find my passion as a software developer and create a unique project to represent my skills. I chose full-stack module because it was the most interesting project offered. Iâ€™ve also tried to set up my environment, I used the visual studio code editor and installed some extensions. 

# I learned the following:
* Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows server-side programming
* Node.js projects use a file called package.json to list dependencies and project info. NPM scripts can be created to run tasks like web servers, and modules play a significant role in Node.js development.
* How to export and import modules in Node.js using 'module.exports' and 'require'. 
* How to work with file paths in Node.js using the 'path' module. Basename, dirname, extension, parse, and join methods for manipulating file paths efficiently.
* How to work with files using FS module in Node.js, including creating, writing, reading, renaming files, and accessing system information using the OS module.
* How to work with URLs using the URL module in Node.js, showcasing methods like getting the host, path, and query parameters, as well as dynamically adding and looping through parameters.
* How to create a logger using event emitter in Node.js, generating random IDs, and emitting events with messages. 
* Creating a web server using core node modules to load HTML pages and CSS files
* Creating a server to handle file requests, setting content types based on file extensions, handling errors like page not found, and loading specific error pages or content based on the request.

* MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI tool that simplifies database management, allowing users to create databases and collections easily. 
* How to effectively query and manipulate data in a database using various methods. Finding, sorting, and updating documents with ease.
* How to use various MongoDB operators to update documents
* Creating a cloud database involves selecting a provider, setting up a cluster, and configuring user access. This process is essential for managing data in applications effectively.

* Express is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, enabling developers to build web applications and APIs with greater efficiency and control. Its flexibility allows for various approaches in handling requests and responses.
* Middleware in Express is essential for handling requests in a stack-like manner, allowing developers to implement various functions seamlessly. This structure makes it easier to manage server requests and responses efficiently.
* Node.js is an essential tool for building web servers, allowing various response methods including sending JSON, files, or rendering HTML templates. Using Express, developers can efficiently serve static files and set up API routes to manage data responses.
* Creating a logging middleware function is essential for tracking requests in an application. This involves exporting the function from a separate file and integrating it into the main application.
* How to retrieve a specific member by ID in an Express.js API using filtering methods. 
* How to set up API routes for creating and retrieving members using Express.js. 
* How to update a member's information in an API using a PUT request
* How to build a CRUD API using Express, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete members from a dataset. Rendering templates with Express Handlebars for a more structured front-end display.
* How to use Handlebars to create a dynamic member list and a form for adding new members via an API. Integrating the members' data and handling form submissions effectively.

* Angular is a powerful front-end framework designed for building single-page applications. It offers a comprehensive set of features, including routing and dependency injection, making development efficient.
* Creating reusable components is essential for efficient development in Angular. 
* How to integrate Font Awesome in an Angular application using the Angular CLI. The installation, usage of icons, and service creation for task management.
* Observables and how to properly subscribe to them.
* How to implement HTTP requests for task management in an application. 
* The process of deleting tasks from a user interface involves filtering out the deleted task from the task list displayed. This is accomplished by making a server request to delete the task and updating the UI accordingly.
* Creating a task management component involves setting up a form for users to input task details. This process includes establishing data binding and validating input before submission.
* How to implement a task management feature by creating an add task component. Emitting events, clearing forms, and making HTTP requests to add tasks successfully.
* How to integrate a UI service with Angular components to manage the visibility of a task addition interface. Using observables to handle button click events effectively.
* The implementation of routing in an Angular application enhances navigation between components. This process involves setting up routes and ensuring components render correctly based on the current route.
